            "3. Knead & Feel: Knead the dough for 1-2 minutes. The goal is a pliable texture like Play-Doh. If it cracks, add 1 tbsp water. If it's sticky, add a sprinkle of masa harina.",

            "7. Repeat: Remove the cooked flatbread and repeat with remaining masa.",
            "8. Cut: Stack the cooked flatbreads and cut into 6 or 8 wedges.",
            "9. Season: In a bowl, toss wedges lightly with oil and finishing salt.",
            "10. To Air Fry: Cook at 380°F (190°C) for 5-8 minutes in a single layer, shaking halfway, until golden and stiff.",
            "11. To Bake: Spread on a baking sheet and bake at 400°F (200°C) for 8-12 minutes, flipping halfway, until golden.",
            "12. Cool: Let chips cool on a wire rack to fully crisp.",
            "13. Finish: Taste and add more salt or a squeeze of lime juice while warm, if desired."
